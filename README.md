# R Matrix Multiplication Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in R related to matrix multiplication. The `bug.R` file contains code that incorrectly performs element-wise multiplication instead of proper matrix multiplication.  The `bugSolution.R` file provides the corrected code.

The difference between these operations is crucial for accurate linear algebra calculations in R.
